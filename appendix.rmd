# Introduction

Welcome to the online online appendix of the master thesis "Improving Forecasting for Foreign Policy". On this site you will find further information on the forecasting tournament, the tools employed and the methodology. For a basic overview and the forecasting results of the tournament see the [tournament website](https://corrod3.github.io/SecurityPolicyForecastingTournament/). If anything remains unclear, don't hesitate to write an [email](a.sacharow@mpp.hertie-school.org). 

# Methodology

## Brier Score

The Brier score was originally proposed to quantify the accuracy of weather forecasts, but can be used to describe the accuracy of any probabilistic forecast. Roughly, the Brier score indicates how far away from the truth your forecast was.

The Brier score is the squared error of a probabilistic forecast. To calculate it, we divide your forecast by 100 so that your probabilities range between 0 (0%) and 1 (100%). Then, we code reality as either 0 (if the event did not happen) or 1 (if the event did happen). For each answer option, we take the difference between your forecast and the correct answer, square the differences, and add them all together. For a yes/no question where you forecasted 70% and the event happened, your score would be (1 – 0.7)2 + (0 – 0.3)2 = 0.18. The best (lowest) possible Brier score is 0, and the worst (highest) possible Brier score is 2.

For further information see [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score) or [The Good Judgement Open](https://www.gjopen.com/faq).

## Score Board

The score board is computed by averaging the Brier scores of each participants and ranking them from the lowest to the highes Brier score. As all participants are required to give judgements to all question, no gambling by not answering questions is possible.
