# Introduction

Welcome to the online glossary of the Security Policy Forecasting Tournament. On this site you find further information which should help you to get a better grasp of the tournament. After the tournament the results and background information regarding the questions will be published on this site. If anything remains unclear, don't hesitate to write an [email](a.sacharow@mpp.hertie-school.org).

# Purpose and aim
Forecasting tournaments are a useful tool to better understand and improve forecasting. They have been extensively used in many future-oriented fields like weather predictions and financial markets. However, only recently they have been introduced to forecasting in international politics. (e.g. [The Good Judgement Project](www.gjopen.com)). The Security Policy Forecasting Tournament is continuing this effort. Its particular goals are to increase awareness of crowd-based forecasting in Europe and to gain further understanding in the relevance of successful forecasting for policy makers. 

# Methodology

## Brier Score

The Brier score was originally proposed to quantify the accuracy of weather forecasts, but can be used to describe the accuracy of any probabilistic forecast. Roughly, the Brier score indicates how far away from the truth your forecast was.

The Brier score is the squared error of a probabilistic forecast. To calculate it, we divide your forecast by 100 so that your probabilities range between 0 (0%) and 1 (100%). Then, we code reality as either 0 (if the event did not happen) or 1 (if the event did happen). For each answer option, we take the difference between your forecast and the correct answer, square the differences, and add them all together. For a yes/no question where you forecasted 70% and the event happened, your score would be (1 – 0.7)2 + (0 – 0.3)2 = 0.18. The best (lowest) possible Brier score is 0, and the worst (highest) possible Brier score is 2.
