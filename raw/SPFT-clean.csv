I would say, that my method to answer those specific questions was not entirely based on my knowledge and experience in foreign and security policy. It rather took into account to given time frame and an estimation, if something seems feasible within this two months window. For example: I would definately see a high probability, that the US might impose new sanctions on Iran and abandon the current Agreement. I just do not think, that it will be possible to process this until April 24. 

Questions on specific events (such as terrorist-attacks) are more tough though to forecast. As we now, even our Intelligence Community can not do that. Therefore, my forecasts here are more based on mathematics, meaning that in general, a terrorist attack ist, despite being a modern threat, rather unlikely at a given time or place. Here again, the time frame plays are role: If the question would be ""Do you think, there will be a devestating Terrorist attack somewhere in Western Europe in the next 10 years"", I would definately give it a 95% rate of probability. But if the question is, if I think there will be devestating Terrorist attack in City X tomorrow, that probability is very low, statistically speaking. This is way I rather gave low scores on questions related to such events. ","916.602","Male","1983","Master's degree","    Employed for wages","58163010","Control"

Mostly because DJT is a complete enigma but also because I just assumed I knew what I was talking about and how Congress would behave.  In retrospect, that might prove to be totally wrong.  Other pieces of the world I was less familiar with I tried not predict too heavily either way. If I know nothing about a conflict, I'm not going to predict its results with 100% certainty.

Let's take the cease-fire and peace treaty negotiations as an example.
I read some coverage about the negotiations in Syria and I know that the rebels have lost a lot of its ground, but I'm no expert. Yet I can infer knowledge - from East Asian or European history and also from Paul Collier's ""The bottom billion""), who actually analyzed civil wars in a statisical way. This, together with intuition replacing a more thorough analysis leads me to the following conclusions:
- It's rather likely that cease-fire agreements are broken, if at least one party has some interest in continuing the fights if there is no clear victor (e. g. Syrian government), or the notion of Collier that civil wars are very likely to break out again. Also, terrorist attacks are likely in Syria and they are likely to jeopardize cease-fire agreements.
- If a cease-fire agreement is broken, a peace treaty is less likely to follow. Even if the cease-fire agreement is maintained and the balance of power is clear (e. g. Japan 1945), peace treaty negotiations usually take a lot of time (Treaty of San Francisco with Japan & USA) and are often not done at all (cf. Korean War or that there's no peace treaty between Russia and Japan yet), especially if one party is not a recognized government or one party doesn't recognize the other (e. g. FARC agreement, Taiwan/ PRC China). Finally, the presence of the Islamic State as an actor, virtually noone recognizes, lowers the probability of peace agreements too...
Yet, I believe in surprises in history and I hope the 2% probability of some peace treaty comes true.","1322.267","Male","1987","Master's degree","    A student","24554466","Control"
